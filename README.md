In the past decade, digital art has gained enormous attraction and popularity for people whose age group could not be more different.

There are several manufacturers of digital photo frames that all do the same thing:
Play back images previously saved on a memory card. To make this product more interesting, as part of a project work for the Systemadministration course, a system is to be created that scales the stored images into a smaller resolution and displays them on a simple LED matrix instead of on a screen. Due to the RGB with ~ 16 million colors, there are interesting possibilities here. We want to use it to make art more digital in order to bring technology-loving people closer to art - and vice versa.
